Super simple way to get growl notifications from twitter mentions.

set up:
1. install Twitter and ruby-growl gems
2. set up Growl to accept remote connections
3. find and insert OAUTH tokens into the Authenticate method
4. run!

note: branches a process that must be killed remotely.  This is my first real ruby project so this will be fixed in the near future.

TODO:
-store OAUTH info in a YAML file
-use Streaming API
-kill forked process when you kill the app
